# Advanced-Encyption-Standard-AES-
An 8086 Implementation of a 128bit Advanced Encyption Standard (AES)
The Advanced Encryption Standard or AES is a symmetric block cipher used by the
U.S. government to protect classified information and is implemented in software and
hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. The AES operates on a 128
bit bursts as well as 128 bits key.


Build two Procedures based on interrupts that reads 128 bits from the user and
prints the result on the screen.
Use Macros to implement SubBytes(), ShiftRows(), MixColumns(), AddRoundKey()
modules, all work on 128 bits.
The usage of EMU8086 as an emulator for this project is encouraged if you
prefer using any other 8086 emulator it is acceptable:
